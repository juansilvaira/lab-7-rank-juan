kermit

# Made a histogram

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes (x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)

Creator: doing some rank-based tests

```{r}

# Is there a significant difference in pre-talk kermit scores for males and females?

# Unpaired data: Mann-Whitney U

mwu_kermit <- kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .)

mwu_kermit
